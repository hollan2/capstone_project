Welcome to Isle of Trust! Let's go over some fundamental game mechanics.
~The goal of the game is to.....
~Explain the Prisoner's dilemma - what cooperate, reciprocate, compete means
~This is you. Here you can find information about yourself such as how many resourses you have, how many times you've cooperated, how many times you've cheated, etc.
~This is the action pannel, this is where all game decisions are made.
~Note the "Promise Phase" label. Each turn has 3 phases: Promise phase, Action phase, and Resource allocation.
~The Promise Phase is exactly what it sounds like, you make a promise to your neighbors that you will either cooperate, reciprocate, or compete.
~Give it a try, make a promise to your neighbour.
~Stage 9 filler
~Great choice! Now it's time to decide whether or not you will keep your promise.
~Note the "Action Phase" label. If you are unsure of which phase in the game you are on, you can always double check here.
~During the Action Phase you can decide if you want to lie to your neighbor or uphold your promise. Remember lying too many times can have a negative effect on your reputation.
~Stage 13 filler

~You can see how many resources they have, how many times they've cooperated, and so on.
~If you scroll down to the bottom you can view a log of all the moves made by that player.
~Lastly if you get stuck and would like a quck summary of how the game works, you can find it in the NavBar under "How to play".
~Congratulations on finishing Level 0! Play a few rounds to get used to the buttons.
