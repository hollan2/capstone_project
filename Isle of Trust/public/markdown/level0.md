Welcome to Isle of Trust! Let's go over some fundamental game mechanics.
~The goal of the game is to.....
~Explan the Prisoner's dillema - what cooperate, reciprocate, compete means
~This is you. Here you can find information about yourself such as how many resourses you have, how many times you've cooperated,how many times you've cheated, etc.
~This is the action pannel, this is where all game decisions are made.
~Note the "Promise Phase" label. Each turn has 3 phases: Promise phase, Action phase, and Resource allocation.
~The promise phase is exactly what it sounds like, you make a promise to your neighbors that you will either cooperate, reciprocate, or compete.
~Go ahead, make a promise to your neighbour.
~Stage 9 filler
~Great choice! Now it's time to decide whether or not you will keep your promise.
~Note the "Action Phase" label. Here you can decide if you want to lie to your neighbor or uphold your promise. The choice is yours.
~Stage 12 filler
