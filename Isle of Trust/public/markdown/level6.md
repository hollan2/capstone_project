A new person has joined the island! Profe is a teacher by nature and has only one goal: to bring out the best in others.
~Profe always follows through on their promises and will reciprocate your intentions as long as you don't compete with them. However, if you choose to engage in competition, Profe will try to show you the error of your ways by setting a good example.
~This time you don't have direct contact with everyone on the island so you must rely on your immediate connections to help spread your intentions.
~To beat this level: Just like before, make sure everyone survives the next 10 years and is able to pay 5 tons of cherries for their mortgage.
