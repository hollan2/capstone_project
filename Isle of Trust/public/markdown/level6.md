I think you’re really starting to get the hang of this! In fact, why don’t you take over?
~If you save 15 tons, over as many rounds as you need, you can turn Domran’s personality into that of Rec’s!
~If you invest the same amount in Pessimo, you can change them to be like Susi. From there, you can treat Pessimo as you did with Susi previously to end up like Rec, through the three rounds of “teaching”.
~To beat the game: There can be three results. If, by the end of 10 years, you can change everyone to be like Rec, you’ll get a gold medal! If you can change at least Domran to be like Rec, you’ll be rewarded with a silver medal. If you are able to simply survive, with the group as a whole accumulating at least 30 tons, then you’ll get a bronze medal.
~Good luck! Once that is done, feel free to experiment with the free-play, where you’ll meet many different people with varying personalities just like the ones you’ve seen here.
