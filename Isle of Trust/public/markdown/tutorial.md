On the Isle of Trust, agents interact using set strategies, aiming to survive. Each round, agents either give **resources** to their neighbors for mutual gain, or selfishly cheat them for extra resources at the cost of their relationship. If agents run out of resources, they die, so they have to be careful!

To play the game, you must create one of these agents. You'll pick an **ideology** and its associated **strategy**. Along the way, you can spend resources to influence your neighbors to follow your agent's ideology, spreading it far and wide.

### The Game Settings

The pawn represents your agent on the board.

Ideology determines how your agent will distribute resources to your neighbors. Will it selfishly cheat for extra resources, or will it altruistically give for a modest mutual gain?

-   The **Dove** ideology is altruistic and always gives.
-   The **Hawk** ideology is selfish and always cheats.
-   The **Grim** ideology is altruistic, but responds poorly to selfishness.
-   The **Anti-Grim** ideology is selfish, but responds well to altruism.
-   The **Tit-for-Tat** ideology copies the behavior shown to them.
-   The **Tweedle-Dum** ideology is selfish, but switches strategies every three times it's been cheated.
-   The **Tweedle-Dee** ideology is altruistic, but switches strategies every three times it's been cheated.

The different maps determine the shape of the neighborhood. Your placement in the neighborhood is random, but the different shapes can have an effect as to how many neighbors you will be interacting with.

Once you are done with your selections, click on the Start button.

### Gameplay

When you open the game, you'll see an interface with your agent highlighted on the left, and the agent you've selected on the right.
Selecting an agent allows you to view some information about it, such as its mood. You can select agents by clicking on their pawns inside the map.

Each agent has a number of resources that represent its finances. If an agent goes under 0 resources, it dies!

Note the influence section in the bottom left of the screen. While your agent will always decide to give our cheat autonomously, you can put resources towards influencing your neighbors here. Think of these resources as humanitarian aid, advertising, or even propaganda. If you're lucky, influencing your neighbors will cause them listen to your ideas, and if you're extra lucky, they'll convert to your ideology.

When you press the "confirm influence" button, the round ends, and the following events happen:

1. All agents choose how to put their resources towards influencing their neighbors. Then, they act on those choices. <insert gif here>
2. Agents give resources, or cheat and withhold resources. If both agents give, they both gain 2 resources; if both agents cheat, they both gain 1 resource; if one gives and one cheats, the cheater gains 3 resources while the giver gets nothing. <insert gif here>
3. Every agent on the board consumes 2 resources to stay alive.
4. Every relationship on the board degrades slightly due to the passage of time.

Gameplay continues, going back to step 1, until you as the player are satisfied with what you've learned.
