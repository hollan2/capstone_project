The year is 1950 and you've been swept to the Isle of Trust. You and your neighbors share a cherry orchard, where you will decide if you work together or apart from your neighbors. Each round you will make a **promise** to your neighbors and then you will have a chance to **act** on that promise. Be careful what you decide because certain actions might upset your neighbors and you might loose cherries!

### Your neighbors

-   The **Suspicious**: They don't like working together with anybody.
-   The **Student**: They're like Suspicious, but can learn to work together.
-   The **Random**: They like deciding what to do on a whim.
-   The **Reciprocator**: Whatever you decide, they will do the same.
-   The **Teacher**: They're like Reciprocators, but can teach Students to work together.
