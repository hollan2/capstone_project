~Welcome to Isle of Trust! This is a game about competition and cooperation and about making or breaking promises. Let's go over some fundamental game mechanics.
~This is you. Here you can find information about yourself such as how many resources you have, how many times you were honest, how many times you've cheated, etc.
~This is the action panel, where all game decisions are made.
~Note the "Promise Phase" label. Each turn has 3 phases: Promise, Action, and Resource Allocation.
~The Promise phase is exactly what it sounds like, you make a promise to your neighbors that you will either cooperate (together), reciprocate (match), or compete(solo).
~Give it a try, make a promise to your neighbor.
~Stage 7 filler
~Great choice! Now it's time to decide whether or not you will keep your promise.
~Note the "Action Phase" label. If you are unsure of which phase in the game you are on, you can always double check here.
~During the Action phase you can decide if you want to lie to your neighbor or uphold your promise. Remember lying too many times can have a negative effect on your reputation.
