Welcome to your very first isle! Here, you’re with Rec, where the two of you share a cherry orchard.
~Rec is a person who believes in the idea of reciprocity. In other words, Rec will treat you the way you treat them.
~It is 1951, and both of you have 5 tons of cherries. If you cooperate, both of you will obtain two tons of cherries for the year. If you cheat, you will get three tons, and they will lose two. But remember, Rec believes in reciprocity.
~At the end of 1961 (10 turns), you are expected to pay 5 tons of cherries for the mortgage.
~To beat this level: use what you learned about reciprocity, cheating, and cooperation to never go below 1 ton of cherries in your storage and have enough to pay for the mortgage.
