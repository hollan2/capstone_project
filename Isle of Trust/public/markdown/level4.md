Ahoy! Domran has arrived. However, unlike Susi and Rec, Domran has washed ashore with a staggering 8 tons of cherries!
~You find out that Domran spends their time drinking, and as a result, you have no certainty as to whether they will keep their word, nor their general behavior.
~Remember that history exists, and may be helpful for more than one individual, and perhaps any trends you may notice!
~To beat this level: Make sure that no one on the island is out of the game for another 10 years. Once this is over, each person must pay another 5 tons in mortgage. ~Feel free to be friendly and help others to keep the group afloat.
