Looks like thereâ€™s yet another person that has washed ashore, Pessimo! However, it seems that Pessimo has come along with absolutely nothing of value, 0 tons of cherries.
~Pessimo, like Susi, is suspicious. However, you may find they may not be as swayed to join your favor as Susi... This person is unable to trust, and as a result will favor competition over all else.
~To beat this level: Make sure nobody on the island is out of the game for yet another 10 years. Once that is over, each person must pay their share of 5 tons of cherries for the mortgage. As always, if you have more, feel free to help others to keep them afloat!
