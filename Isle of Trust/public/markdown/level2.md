A new person, Susi has come onto the island! Susi only has 2 tons of cherries, and you two also share a cherry orchard, separate from that of Rec.
~You attempt to offer a similar deal you had with Rec to Susi, but Susi refuses, saying they “don’t trust you”.
~Instead, you offer to let Susi win for three years, in which case she says “we’ll see”.
~Susi here will learn to trust you if you let them win for the specified three years, and will then be more open to other offers!
~To beat this level: Make sure that the three of you don’t run out of resources in 10 years. Once those 10 years have passed, each person needs to pay 5 tons of cherries as mortgage.
~Note that if you have more than others, feel free to help them to keep the group sustainable!
