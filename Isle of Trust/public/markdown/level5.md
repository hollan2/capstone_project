Looks like thereâ€™s yet another person that has washed ashore, Pessimo! However, it seems that Pessimo has come along with absolutely nothing of value, 0 tons of cherries.
~Pessimo, like Susi, is suspicious. However, you may find they may not be as swayed to join your favor as Susi... This person is unable to trust, and as a result will favor competition over all else.
~To beat this level: Make sure nobody on the island is out of the game for yet another 10 years. Once that is over, each person must pay their share of 5 tons of cherries for the mortgage. As always, if you have more, feel free to help others to keep them afloat!

~It seems like you're having a hard time with Pessimo, this may be a great time to make a donation to the library to enrich the community.
~If you invest 15 tons (over as many rounds as you need) into the library, you can turn all suspicious personalities (like Pessimo) into students (like Susi)! It looks like somebody already invested the first 12 tons for you so there's only 3 remaining.
