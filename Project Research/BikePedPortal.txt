Q1:What languages are required for the project/ Whatâ€™s the tech stack?

A1: Both Portal and BikePed Portal are built with the Django Framework with SQL, Python
and JavaScript.


Q2: Short description of what the project is

A2:   Portal is a data interface that allows users to pull traffic data for running
analysis. The goal for the project is to create a UI where users of Portal can see
how much data they have at their disposable. It would show if systems were down and
if data is missing from a certain timeframe. This is extremely important as analysts 
need accurate data. 

BikePed Portal is a portal that gives traffic data about non motorized travel
such as biking or walking. This project also needs a new UI but for allowing the
end user to update the metadata about certain locations. Right now they have to 
go into the backend and change things manually through SQL scripts.


Q3: Is it based on a previous project?

A3: Portal is currently an up and running softwate and is currently working on
getting licensing

BikePed Portal is an up and running site that already has licensing.

Both would require signing a contribution form.

Q9: What kind of hardware/software is required if any?
