Developing a smart Dash Cam with a Vehicle Status Display. An SBC (raspberry pi) 
would be used with various sensors to relay information to an external display.


Goals:
Display should view information for location, altitude, speed of other cars, 
pitch/roll/yaw, direction of travel, license plates


Other notes:
New project
Various raspberry pi projects can be found to aid in using different sensors


Software:

* Detecting license plates
* Detecting speeds
GUI for Vehicle display


Languages:
Python and/or C++


Hardware: *provided by client
